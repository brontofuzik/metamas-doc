\section{Example 2: Expression Evaluation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Expression evaluation organziation
This example demonstrates a not-so-simple organization - the expression evaluation.
% Function invocation organization - purpose
The purpose of this organization is to facilitate divide-and-conquer expression evaluation by grouping five agents: one agent breaks the expression down (the `divide' part) and the other four compute addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (the `conquer' part).
% Assumptions
In this example, agents evaluate simple arithmetic expressions (consists of natural numbers, four binary operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication and integral division - and parentheses), but it should be apparent that any arithmetic expressions could be evaluated this way.

\subsubsection*{Stage 3: Competence and Responsibility Invocation}

The expression evaluation is initiated by \textit{player1} through its \textit{Evaluator} role and is carried out in a divide-and-conquer fashion by \textit{Evaluator}, \textit{Adder}, \textit{Multiplier} and \textit{Divider} collaborating with one another.
In this example the expression to be evaluated is $(1*2)+(4/2)$.

% Evaluator: "(1*2)+(4/2)"
\textit{Evaluator} to evaluate $(1*2)+(4/2)$: it parses the expression and finds the operation to be applied last - addition.
It splits the expression into two sub-expressions and requests \textit{Adder} to evaluate their sum (the \textbf{first magenta} interaction scenario).
It then reports the value (4) to \textit{player1} (the \textbf{first black} interaction scenario).

% Adder: "(1*2)", "(4/2)"
\textit{Adder} to evaluate the sum of $(1*2)$ and $(4/2)$: it requests \textit{Evaluator} to evaluate both expressions (the \textbf{first cyan} and \textbf{blue} interaction scenarios) and invokes the \textit{Add} responsibility on \textit{player2} to calculate the sum of their values (the \textbf{second cyan} interaction scenario).
It then reports the sum (4) to \textit{Evaluator} (the \textit{first magenta} interaction scenario).

% Evaluator: "(1*2)"

% Multiplier: "1", "2"
\textit{Multiplier} to evaluate the product of $1$ and $2$: it requests \textit{Evaluator} to evaluate both expressions (the \textbf{dark green} and \textbf{light green} interaction scenarios) and invokes the \textit{Multiply} responsibility on \textit{player4} to calculate the product of their values (the \textbf{purple} interaction scenario).
It then reports the product (2) to \textit{Evaluator} (the \textit{pink} interaction scenario).

% Evaluator: "1"
\textit{Evaluator} to evaluate $1$: it parses the expression and finds out it is a number.
It reports the value (1) to \textit{Multiplier} (the \textbf{dark green} interaction scenario).

% Evaluator: "2"
\textit{Evaluator} to evaluate $2$: it parses the expression and finds out it is a number.
It reports the value (2) to \textit{Multiplier} (the \textbf{light green} interaction scenario).

% Evaluator: "(4/2)"
\textit{Evaluator} to evaluate $(1*2)$: it parses the expression and finds the last-to-be-applied operation - division.
It splits the expression into two sub-expressions and requests \textit{Divider} to evaluate their quotient (the \textit{yellow} interaction scenario).
It then reports the value (2) to \textit{Adder} (the \textbf{blue} interaction scenario).

% Divider: "4", "2"
\textit{Divider} to evaluate the quotient of $4$ and $2$: it requests \textit{Evaluator} to evaluate both expressions (the \textbf{red} and \textbf{black} interaction scenarios) and invokes the \textit{Divide} responsibility on \textit{player5} to calculate the quotient of their values (the \textbf{second magenta} interaction scenario).
It then reports the quotient (2) to \textit{Evaluator} (the \textit{yellow} interaction scenario).

% Evaluator: "4"

It reports the value (4) to \textit{Divider} (the \textbf{red} interaction scenario).

% Evaluator: "2"
