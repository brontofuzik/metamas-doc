Instructions On How to Run the Examples
---------------------------------------

* Make sure Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed on your computer. Jade 4.1.1 requires at least version 5, and Thespian4Jade requires version 7 or higher. Also, make sure 'java' is a recognized command by including the path to 'java.exe' in the Path environment variable.

* To run an example on Windows, simply execute the 'run.bat' batch file located in the 'bin' folder.

* To run an example on Linux, simply execute the 'run.sh' shell script located in the 'bin' fodler.

* We recommend to run the examples on Windows (if possible), since we have experienced some difficulties when trying to run them on Linux (the jade.core.IMTPException was thrown).

* Source code for Jade, Thespian4Jade and all three examples is provided, so that you can compile them on your own.
