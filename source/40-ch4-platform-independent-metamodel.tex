\chapter{Platform-Independent Metamodel---Thespian}

% Chapter intro
In this chapter, we will present our platform-independent metamodel for modelling organizations in MASs---\textit{Thespian}.

% Thespian - defnition
\textit{Thespian} is a metamodel to which platform-independent models of organizations in MASs must conform; more precisely, it is a model\footnote{Recall that a metamodel is a kind of model.} representing a modelling language \footnote{When can call this language the \textit{Thespian modelling language}.} to which platform-independent models of organizations in MASs must conform.

% Thespian name inspiration - Thespis of Icaria
The metamodel is named after \textit{Thespis of Icaria} (present-day Dionysos, Greece), who lived in the 6th century BC and, according to certain Ancient Greece sources and especially Aristotle, was the first person ever to appear on stage as an actor playing a character in a play (instead of speaking as themselves) \cite{Wikipedia-Thespis}.

% Thespian inspiration - Aalaadin, O&P, PIM4Agents and powerJade
\textit{Thespian} is inspired by all four metamodels introduced in the previous chapter: \textit{Aalaadin}, \textit{O\&P}, \textit{PIM4Agents} and \textit{powerJade}.
% Aaalaadin
Similarly to \textit{Aalaadin}, it contains both dynamic and static concepts (called \textit{core} and \textit{methodological} concepts in Aalaadin).
Instances of dynamic/static concepts will end up as run-time/design-time entities in the platform-specific model.
% O&P
Like \textit{O\&P}, it can be used to model holonic MASs.
% PIM4Agents
Similarly to \textit{PIM4Agents}, it enables explicit modelling of protocols and messages exchanged in these protocols.
% powerJade 
And finally like \textit{powerJade}, it is able to represent competences and responsibilities (called \textit{powers} and \textit{requirements} respectively in \textit{powerJade}) of roles.

% Static & dynamic models
The metamodel encompasses
\begin{itemize}
	\item a \textit{static model} for modelling static (structural) aspects of organizations, and
	\item a \textit{dynamic model} for modelling their dynamic (behavioural) aspect.
\end{itemize}
In the following two sections, we will introduce both models in detail.
