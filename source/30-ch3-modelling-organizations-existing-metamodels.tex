% TODO Rename to Organization-Centric MAS Metamodels
\chapter{Modelling Organizations -- Existing Approaches}

In this chapter, we will introduce four approaches to modelling organizations in MASs.
All of them are based on platform-independent metamodels.

% PIM
In software engineering, \textit{platform-independent model} (PIM) is a model of a software system, that is independent of the specific technological platform used to implement it \cite{Wikipedia-PIM}.
% PIM - motivation
The main motivation to use a PIM is to build the model once and then automatically transform it to any number of platform-specific models for different deployment platforms.

% PSM
The \textit{platform-specific model} (PSM) is a model of a software system bound to a specific technological platform (e.g. a hardware environment (processor), operating system or software environment (virtual machine)).
% PSM - motivation
Platform-specific models are indispensable for the actual implementation of a software system \cite{Wikipedia-PSM}

\section{Models and Metamodels}

\subsection{Models and Modelling}

% Models, representation, conformance and modelling
Before talking about metamodels and metamodelling, its absolutely necessary to have a clear understanding of models, modelling and two basic relationships: representation and conformance. 

% Model - representation
A \textit{model} is a simplified \textit{representation} of a certain reality, for example, a system \cite{Genova09}.
A system can be represented by a set of different models.
Each model captures a specific aspect (or view) of the system depending on the purpose of that model.
A model must not represent the system with absolute preciseness; it is useful only because it is a simplified representation \cite{Genova09}.

% Model - conformance
A model also has to be expressed in some modelling language.
Therefore, the full definition of a model is the following: a model is a simplified representation of a certain reality \textit{conforming} to the rules of a certain modelling language \cite{Genova09}. In short, a model represents a system and conforms to a metamodel. Figure~\ref{figure:representation-and-conformance} illustrates both relationships.

	\label{figure:representation-and-conformance}
\end{figure}

% Modelling
Modelling, in the most general sense, is the use of a model to represent a certain reality for some cognitive purpose.

% Contextual substitutability
A model is characterized by \textit{contextual substitutability}: it should be able to answer a given set of questions in the same way the system would answer them \cite{Genova09}.

\subsection{Metamodels and Metamodelling}

% Metamodel
A metamodel is a special kind of model that specifies the abstract syntax of a modelling language \cite{OMG-MDA-Foundation-Model}.

% Metamodel - what it represents
A metamodel represents an abstract syntax of a modelling language; it does \textit{not} represent a model or a set of models
\footnote{The popular expression ``model of a model'' is particularly confusing.}.
% Metamodel - what it conforms to
A metamodel conforms to a meta-metamodel.

Consider the metalayers shown figure~\ref{figure:metalayers}:

% Figure: Metalayers
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/metalayers.png}
	\caption{Metalayers \cite{Genova09}}
	\label{figure:metalayers}
\end{figure}

% Model conforms to metamodel
On the bottom level, a \textit{model} conforms to a modelling language whose abstract syntax is represented by a \textit{metamodel}.
Transitively, we can say that a \textit{model} conforms to a \textit{metamodel}.

On the middle level, a \textit{metamodel} conforms to a metamodelling language whose abstract syntax is represented by a \textit{meta-metamodel}.
Transitively, we can say that a \textit{metamodel} conforms to a \textit{meta-metamodel}.

On the top level, A \textit{reflexive meta-metamodel} conforms to a language whose abstract syntax is represented by \textit{itself}.
Transitively, we can say that a \textit{meta-metamodel} conforms to \textit{itself}.

% represented-by =/= conforms-to
The represented-by and conforms-to relationships are essentially different; arranging them in the same direction might be confusing.

% Using 'model' to refer to a metamodel
Since metamodels are models themselves, we will use the less cumbersome `model' to refer to a metamodel where it is obvious from the context that we are talking about the metamodel and not one of the models it specifies.
