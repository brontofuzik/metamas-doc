\chapter{Examples}

% Chapter abstract - Thespian4Jade examples
In this chapter, we will present examples demonstrating the usage of the Thespian4Jade library (ALT: module), an extension of the Jade framework.
The examples are ordered by the complexity of the MAS social structure; the first can be considered a toy problem, while the last one is toy problem by no means.

% Examples - specification & manifestation
The MAS in each example is presented in two parts: specification and manifestation.
The specification part presents the model of the MAS and the manifestation part presents a run of the MAS.

% Specification - structure
In all examples, the MAS is modelled using three sub-models: a) organization and role model, b) protocol model and c) player model.

% Manifestation - structure
In all examples, the MAS runs in five stages: 1) role enactment, 2) role activation, 3) competence and responsibility invocation, 4) role deactivation and 5) role deactment.
The third stage is the problem-solving stage - period of time during which the agents solve the problem itself by exercising their competences and fulfilling its responsibilities.
The other stages are infrastructure stages - time intervals during which agents organize themselves into organizations, enact/deact roles and activate/deactivate them.
For the first example, we will provide a detailed description of all five stages; for the second example we will provide a brief description for all stages; and for the third example a brief description of the problem-solving stage will suffice.

% Complete agent interaction diagrams
The complete diagrams of agent interaction in the running MASes are too large to be reproduced here; they can be found on the accompanying CD-ROM.
